When a user interacts with your system (for example: makes a purchase in your app, or clicks on a button in your webpage etc.) one or several events are logged to some server where your analysts can analyze it later. We call this log mechanism for tracking.

The purpose of the  tratt-api library is to help you verify that your tracking mechanism is working as expected at _end-to-end_ level.
