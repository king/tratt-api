# Overview

The purpose of the "tratt-api" library is to help verifying that a **tracking** mechanism is working as expected on an end-to-end level.

When a user interacts with a system, e.g. makes a purchase in an app or clicks a button on a webpage, one or multiple events are logged to a server. These logs on the server can later be used for data analysis. This logging mechanism is referred by King as tracking. The "tratt-api" is a regular java library API and can be used with any test automation framework, e.g. JUnit, TestNG.
