# User Guide

## Overview

When a user interacts with your system (for example: makes a purchase in your app, or clicks on a button in your webpage etc.) one or several events are logged at some server where your analytic's can analyze it later. We call this log mechanism for tracking.

The tratt-api library helps you verify that your tracking mechanism is working as expected at _end-to-end_ level.

The Tratt Definition Language (TDL) is used to specify sequences of expected events (ie. your verification rules). TDL is in JSON format and _easy-to-understand_. TDL is described in detail further below in this User Guide.
